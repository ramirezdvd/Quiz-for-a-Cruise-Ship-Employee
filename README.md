# Quiz-for-a-Cruise-Ship-Employee
In this website I used HTML CSS and JavaScript.
All three files implement interactive quizzes related to NCL, each focusing on a different knowledge area (destinations, officers, or company policies/brand). They share a consistent user interface: navigation bar, progress meter, and feedback system. The main difference is in the content and answer selection method (single vs. multiple answer).
